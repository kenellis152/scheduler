# scheduler
This project is a work in progress. It is a MEAN web application.

Its purpose is to act as a digital kanban scheduling tool for multiple resin cartridge manufacturing plants for the company that I currently work for.

The server is started with: 

```
nodemon server/server.js
```

Backend tests are run with:

```
npm test
```

Frontend tests are run with:

```
karma start
```
